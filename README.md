# Christmas Countdown

## Description:

This is a simple Christmas countdown timer built with vanilla JavaScript.
It shows how many days, hours, minutes, and seconds are left until Christmas.
When Christmas arrives, it displays a "MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!" message and resets for the next year.
I built this project while learning JavaScript to practice:

* Working with dates and timers
* DOM manipulation
* Basic logic and time calculations

## Features:

* Live countdown updated every second
* Automatic reset for the next Christmas
* Simple play/pause music button
